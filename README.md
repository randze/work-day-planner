# My Work Day Planner
A simple work day planner using localstorage and Moment.js.

## How it works
- Can input your task at any time
- Press save button to save tasks to localstorage
- Will check for current time and color the task accordingly if past/present/future

## Improvements to be done
- Refactoring code
- Live color coding without refresh
